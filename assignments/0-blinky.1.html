<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>Welcome to CS140e! We&rsquo;re really excited that you&rsquo;ve decided to join us for
this inaugural incarnation. We hope you have as much fun taking this class as
we&rsquo;ve had developing it! And, of course, we hope you learn a ton.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re hoping to do things a little differently in CS140e than the norm. In
particular, we want <em>you</em> to write the majority of the code, and we want your
code to execute on <em>real</em> hardware, doing <em>real</em> things. There&rsquo;s going to be
very little scaffolding provided for you, and all of your code will target and
run on the Raspberry Pi 3, a quad-core ARMv8 Cortex-A53 based embedded platform.</p>

<p>In CS140e, you&rsquo;ll be programming in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a>, a &ldquo;a systems programming language
that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.&rdquo; You
can think of Rust as a successor to C and C++, but it&rsquo;s  more useful to think of
it as a brand new language with new concepts. Don&rsquo;t try to program in Rust as if
it&rsquo;s C, C++, Java, or any other language you&rsquo;re used to. Instead, see it as an
opportunity to learn a new way to write software - a new <em>rusty</em> way. By the end
of the term, we think you&rsquo;ll agree that Rust helps your write more correct, more
reliable software - key properties for operating systems!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be writing a lot of code in CS140e, though we think that the majority of
your time will be spent thinking about what needs to happen. We expect that most
assignments will take about 10 - 15 hours a week to complete. You should, under
no circumstance, procrastinate in CS140e. Start early, ask questions, and have
fun - you&rsquo;ll learn much more if you give yourself a chance to think through hard
problems.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re here to answer any and all questions. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out
to us. Best of luck!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>In this assignment, you will set up and test a Raspberry Pi 3, ARM64 development
environment for your use throughout the rest of the course. You&rsquo;ll install the
necessary tools and write your first bare-metal application, an LED blinky
program, in two languages: C and Rust.</p>

<p>This assignment is divided into 4 phases. In the first phase, you&rsquo;ll install the
necessary software to communicate with your Pi from your machine. You&rsquo;ll also
ensure that your Pi works as expected by running a pre-compiled program. In the
second phase, you&rsquo;ll connect GPIO pin 16 on your Raspberry Pi to an LED on a
breadboard and run a second pre-compiled program to ensure your connections are
sound. In the third phase, you&rsquo;ll install an <code>aarch64-none-elf</code> cross-compiler,
allowing you to compile and link programs for your Pi from your machine. You&rsquo;ll
write, compile, and link a C program that toggles GPIO pin 16 on and off,
blinking the LED connected to your Pi. Finally, in phase 4, you&rsquo;ll install
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> and the necessary toolchain to write, compile, and link the same program
in Rust.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="phase-0-getting-started">Phase 0: Getting Started</h3>

<p>First, ensure that you are working on this assignment using a compatible
machine. For CS140e, compatible means that the machine meets the following
requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Runs a modern Unix natively: Linux, BSD, or macOS</li>
<li>Runs a 64-bit variant of the OS</li>
<li>Has a USB-A port or USB-C to USB-A adapter</li>
</ul>

<p>And has the following software installed: <code>git</code>, <code>wget</code>, <code>tar</code>, <code>screen</code>, and
<code>make</code>.</p>

<p>If you are running Windows, we suggest that you partition your boot disk now and
install <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu LTS</a> or <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/">Fedora</a> on a secondary partition. You may also have
luck working on assignments using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Linux Subsystem for Windows</a>, but we
won&rsquo;t be providing support for or answering questions about this configuration.</p>

<h4 id="getting-your-pi-ready">Getting your Pi Ready</h4>

<p>Check that your Raspberry Pi kit includes all of the following materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Raspberry Pi 3</li>
<li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-sized breadboard</li>
<li>1 4GiB microSD card</li>
<li>1 microSD card USB adapter</li>
<li>1 CP2102 USB TTL adapter w/4 jumper cables</li>
<li>10 multicolored LEDs</li>
<li>4 100 ohm resistors</li>
<li>4 1k ohm resistors</li>
<li>10 male-male DuPont jumper cables</li>
<li>10 female-male DuPont jumper cables</li>
</ul>

<p>To set up for this assignment, unbox your Raspberry Pi, micro SD card,
breadboard, and USB CP2102 module. Electronics are sensitive to electrostatic
discharge, so ensure that you ground yourself by touching something conductive
before touching any electronics. Prepare two male to female jumper cables for
use as well as one resistor (any resistor!) and one LED. Finally, ready the USB
microSD card adapter.</p>

<h4 id="getting-the-skeleton-code">Getting the Skeleton Code</h4>

<p>Clone the assignment 0 skeleton git repository to your development machine and
then fetch the required files by running <code>make fetch</code> inside the directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git clone https://cs140e.sergio.bz/assignments/0-blinky/skeleton.git <span style="color:#1c01ce">0</span>-blinky
<span style="color:#a90d91">cd</span> assignment0
make fetch</code></pre></div>
<p>Feel free to explore the contents of the repository.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-baking-pi">Phase 1: Baking Pi</h3>

    padding: 10px;

   <img src="0-blinky/images/usb-module.jpg"
       alt="CP2102 USB Module"
      

      
       width="240px" 
      style="
         
      "/>
   
</figure>


<p>The primary means through which you&rsquo;ll be powering and communicating with your
Pi is via a CP2102 USB module. That&rsquo;s the red USB dongle with the five pins.</p>

<h4 id="installing-drivers">Installing Drivers</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re running Linux, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything for your machine to
recognize the module correctly. If you&rsquo;re running macOS, you&rsquo;ll need to install
a driver. <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip">Download this zip
file</a>,
double-click to unzip it, and then double-click the resulting
<code>SiLabsUSBDriverDisk.dmg</code> file. Accept the terms. In the newly mounted volume,
you&rsquo;ll see a <code>Silicon Labs VPC Driver.pkg</code> file. Double-click to run and follow
the on-screen prompts to install the driver. Once complete, restart your
machine. After rebooting, you&rsquo;ll be ready to continue.</p>

<p>Insert the CP2102 module into a USB slot on your machine. If everything worked
well, you should see a new file in <code>/dev</code> corresponding to the device. On macOS,
this will be <code>/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART</code>. On Linux, this will likely be
<code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. Before continuing, you may wish to record this path. You&rsquo;ll be
referring to it a lot in the future.</p>

<p>Now unplug the CP2102 module from your machine.</p>

<h4 id="powering-the-pi">Powering the Pi</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll now connect the Raspberry Pi to the CP2102 module using the four
female-female jumper cables included in the module&rsquo;s package. The table below
shows which pins on the CP2102 module you should connect to which pins on the
Raspberry Pi:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CP2102 Pin</th>
<th>Pi Physical Pin</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>+5v</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GND</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>RXD</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TXD</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the pins are numbered on the Raspberry Pi 3:</p>

       width="550px" 
      style="
          display: block; margin: 0 auto; 
      "/>
   
</figure>


<p>Here&rsquo;s what the connections should look like:</p>

<figure style="
   
    padding: 10px; 
">
   <img src="0-blinky/images/usb-ttl-pi3.png"
       alt="USB TTL Connections"
      

      
       width="450px" 
      style="
          display: block; margin: 0 auto; 
      "/>
   
</figure>


<p>Double-check, triple-check, and quadruple-check your connections! Then, get a
friend to double-check your connections! Incorrect wiring can result in a fried
Raspberry Pi, which will result in an automatic F in this course. Okay, that
last bit isn&rsquo;t true, but Raspberry Pi 3&rsquo;s are expensive, and we don&rsquo;t want to
pass out additional ones if we can prevent it. So, quintuple-check your
connections before continuing!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re confident in your connections, it&rsquo;s time to plug in your CP2102 module
into your computer. If all went well, you should see a red LED light on your
Raspberry Pi shining bright. Congratulations! You&rsquo;re now able to power and
communicate with your Pi.</p>

<h4 id="running-programs">Running Programs</h4>

<p>As discussed in lecture, the Raspberry Pi loads programs on boot from the
on-board microSD card. We&rsquo;ll now set up our microSD card with a custom program
for the Raspberry Pi to load.</p>

<p>Take the microSD card and insert it into the USB microSD card adapter. Then,
plug the adapter into your machine. You should see a new volume mounted on your
machine. Copy the three files inside of the <code>files/firmware</code> directory in the
skeleton (<code>bootcode.bin</code>, <code>config.txt</code>, and <code>start.elf</code>) to the root of the
microSD card. (If you don&rsquo;t see these files, make sure you&rsquo;ve run <code>make fetch</code>
inside the skeleton repository.) As discussed in lecture, these are three of the
four files read by the GPU on boot. The fourth, <code>kernel8.img</code>, is the boot
program, which we are about to install.</p>


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
   <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">
      
         <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 3px"></span>
      
      What are bootcode.bin, config.txt, and start.elf?
   </p>
   <p><p>These specially-named files are recognized by the Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s GPU on
  boot-up and used to configure and boostrap the system. <code>bootcode.bin</code> is the
  GPU&rsquo;s first-stage bootloader. Its primary job is to load <code>start.elf</code>, the
  GPU&rsquo;s second-stage bootloader. <code>start.elf</code> initializes the ARM CPU,
  configuring it as indicated in <code>config.txt</code>, loads <code>kernel8.img</code> into memory,
  and instructs the CPU to start executing the newly loaded code from
  <code>kernel8.img</code>.</p>
</p>
</div>



<p>Now, copy <code>files/activity-led-blink.bin</code> from the skeleton to the root of the
microSD card and name the file <code>kernel8.img</code>. Unmount the microSD card,
disconnect the USB adapter from your machine, and remove the microSD card from
the USB adapter. Ensure your Raspberry Pi 3 isn&rsquo;t currently powered. Then,
insert the microSD card into the Rasperry Pi 3. Plug in the Pi. In just a short
moment, you should see a green LED on the Raspberry Pi board blinking once every
two seconds for one second at a time. You should also see a blue LED on the USB
CP2102 adapter blinking at the same frequency. This indicates that data is being
sent to/from the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>But what data? To see the data the Raspberry Pi is sending, you&rsquo;ll need to run a
serial console emulator that connects to the CP2102 module and reads the
incoming data. We&rsquo;ll use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#Overview">screen</a> since it comes preinstalled on Linux and
macOS. Recalling the <code>/dev</code> path from before, connect to the CP2102 USB module
with screen by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">screen /dev/&lt;your-path&gt; <span style="color:#1c01ce">115200</span></code></pre></div>
<p>On Linux, you may have to use <code>sudo</code> to run the command. Alternatively, you can
add yourself to the <code>dialout</code> user group to avoid using <code>sudo</code>: <code>sudo gpasswd
--add &lt;your-username&gt; dialout</code>.</p>

<p>You should see friendly messages from your Raspberry Pi. To exit <code>screen</code>, use
<code>&lt;ctrl-a&gt; k</code> then answer <code>y</code> at the prompt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="phase-2-led-there-be-light">Phase 2: LED There Be Light</h3>

<p>In this phase, you&rsquo;ll connect GPIO pin 16 (physical pin 36) on the Raspberry Pi
to an LED light on a breadboard. You&rsquo;ll test the LED using a pre-compiled
binary. Before starting, ensure your Raspberry Pi is unplugged.</p>


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
   <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">
      
         <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 3px"></span>
      
      Is it <em>safe</em> to simply unplug the USB TTL adapter?
   </p>
   <p><p>Yes! On a traditional computer, and later on in the course, removing the power
  source without consideration is a bad idea because operations, typically on
  the disk, may be in-flight. Stopping these operations midway can result in
  damaged hardware or inconsistent state on the next boot-up. For now, our Pis
  have no state or moving hardware, so we don&rsquo;t need to worry about this. Feel
  free to simply unplug its power source!</p>
</p>
</div>



<h4 id="gpio-general-purpose-i-o">GPIO: General Purpose I/O</h4>

<p>GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output. As the name implies, GPIO is a
general mechanism for transmitting data/signals into and out of some
device through electrical pins, known as GPIO pins.</p>

<p>A GPIO pin can act as either an output or input. When a GPIO pin is acting as an
output, it can either be set on or off. When on, the Raspberry Pi drives the pin
at 3.3v. When the GPIO pin is off, no current flows through the pin. When a GPIO
pin is acting as an input, the Raspberry Pi reports whether the pin is being
driven at 3.3v or not.</p>

<p>GPIO pins are incredibly versatile and can be used to implement a wide array of
functionality. You can read more about GPIO on the Raspberry Pi Foundation&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio-plus-and-raspi2/README.md">GPIO Usage Documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="testing-the-led">Testing the LED</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start by constructing the circuit below:</p>

<figure style="
   
    padding: 10px; 
">
   <img src="0-blinky/images/always-on-led-circuit.svg"
       alt="Raspberry Pi 3 Always-On LED"
      

      
      
      style="
          display: block; margin: 0 auto; 
      "/>
   
</figure>


<p>If you&rsquo;ve never used a breadboard, we suggest reading through <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard">SparkFun&rsquo;s &ldquo;How
to Use a Breadboard&rdquo; guide</a>. This circuit connects an LED to always-on 3.3v
power on the Raspberry Pi. Note that pin 1 (+3.3v) on the Raspberry Pi should go
to the <em>longer</em> leg of your LED. The shorter leg is connected to the resistor
which in-turn is connected to pin 14 (ground) on the Pi.</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve confirmed your connections, plug the Raspberry Pi in. Your LED
should turn on. After you&rsquo;ve confirmed that the LED works as expected, unplug
your Rapsberry Pi. Then, move the jumper cable from pin 1 on the Pi to pin 36
(GPIO Pin 16) as illustrated below:</p>

<figure style="
   
    padding: 10px; 
">
   <img src="0-blinky/images/gpio-16-led-circuit.svg"
       alt="Raspberry Pi 3 GPIO LED"
      

      
      
      style="
          display: block; margin: 0 auto; 
      "/>
   
</figure>


<p>Copy <code>files/gpio16-blink.bin</code> from the skeleton repository to the microSD card
as <code>kernel8.img</code>, replacing any existing <code>kernel8.img</code> file on the card. Start
the Raspberry Pi with the new image. Your LED should start blinking.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="phase-3-shining-c">Phase 3: Shining C</h3>

<p>In this phase, you&rsquo;ll write the program that produced <code>gpio16-blink.bin</code> in C.
You&rsquo;ll write your code in <code>phase3/blinky.c</code>. To be able to compile C and assembly
programs for the Raspberry Pi, we&rsquo;ll install a cross compiler for the
<code>aarch64-none-elf</code> target.</p>

<h4 id="installing-a-cross-compiler">Installing a Cross-Compiler</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll now install the <code>aarch64-none-elf</code> GNU toolchain (<code>gcc</code> and friends),
allowing you to compile and link C and assembly code for our Raspberry Pi from a
non-Raspberry Pi machine.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>macOS Installation Steps</strong></p>

<p>First, we&rsquo;ll install <a href="https://brew.sh">homebrew</a>, a popular package manager for macOS. If you
already have <code>brew</code> installed, skip this step.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install the Xcode command line tools by running the shell command below. A
 dialog should pop up on your screen. Click &ldquo;Install&rdquo; when it appears.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">xcode-select --install</code></pre></div></li>

<li><p>Run Homebrew’s install script by using the command below. The script will
 guide you through the rest of the install process.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">/usr/bin/ruby -e <span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span><span style="color:#a90d91">$(</span>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install<span style="color:#a90d91">)</span><span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>

<p>We&rsquo;ll now install the <code>aarch64-none-elf</code> toolchain using homebrew.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;Tap&rdquo; into a custom set of macOS cross-compilation packages and install
 the toolchain using the command below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">brew tap SergioBenitez/osxct

<h4 id="talking-to-hardware">Talking to Hardware</h4>

<p>The vast majority of modern hardware devices communicate with software through
<em>memory-mapped I/O</em>. The concept is simple: devices expose their functionality
through the machine&rsquo;s memory and provide a specification about what will happen
if certain addresses are read or written to. Addresses are usually separated
into 32 or 64-bit sized regions known as <em>registers</em>. Registers are usually
named to indicate their functionality. Registers can be read-only, write-only,
or read/write.</p>

<p>How do we know which registers a device exposes, where in memory they&rsquo;re mapped,
and what they do? Device manufacturers document all of this information in what
is typically referred to as a &ldquo;data sheet&rdquo;, &ldquo;device manual&rdquo;, or simply
&ldquo;documentation&rdquo;. There is no widespread format for how devices are documented,
and documentation quality is hit or miss. Reading and understanding hardware
documentation is a skill and art.</p>

<h4 id="gpio-memory-mapped-interface">GPIO Memory-Mapped Interface</h4>

<p>The documentation for many of the peripherals on-board the Rasperry Pi can be
found in Broadcom&rsquo;s <a href="../docs/BCM2837-ARM-Peripherals.pdf">BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual</a>. The documentation for
GPIO, for example, is on page 89.</p>


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
   <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">
      
         <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 3px"></span>
      
      Wait, aren&rsquo;t we using a BCM2837 chip?
   </p>
   <p><p>If you open the manual we&rsquo;ve linked you to, you&rsquo;ll see references to the
  BCM2835 chip everywhere. This is because we&rsquo;ve simply taken the documentation
  for the BCM2835 chip, fixed relevant errata, and fixed the title to say
  BCM2837.</p>

<p>The BCM2837 and BCM2835 share the same peripherals with the same <em>relative</em>
  memory-mapped interfaces. The main difference is that the chips differ in
  their physical memory configuration. This results in the BCM2837 having a
  peripheral physical base address of <code>0x3F000000</code> as opposed to the BCM2835&rsquo;s
  <code>0x20000000</code>. But both chips map this range to the <em>peripheral</em> base address
  of <code>0x7E000000</code>. In short, a peripheral address <code>0x7EXXXXXX</code> is at physical
  address <code>0x3FXXXXXX</code> on the BCM2837. The &ldquo;BCM2837&rdquo; documentation we&rsquo;ve linked
  to contains this change.</p>
</p>
</div>



<p>For this assignment, we&rsquo;ll only need to use the following three registers:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>name</th>
<th>peripheral address</th>
<th>description</th>
<th>size</th>
<th>read/write</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>GPFSEL1</td>
<td>0x7E200004</td>
<td>GPIO Function Select 1</td>
<td>32 bits</td>
<td>R/W</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GPSET0</td>
<td>0x7E20001C</td>
<td>GPIO Pin Output Set 0</td>
<td>32 bits</td>
<td>W</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GPCLR0</td>
<td>0x7E200028</td>
<td>GPIO Pin Output Clear 0</td>
<td>32 bits</td>
<td>W</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>We&rsquo;ve copied this information directly from page 90 of the documentation.</p>

<p>Now, read the documentation for <code>GPFSELn</code> register on pages 91 and 92. We write
to this register to set up a pin as an output or input. Which value to which
field in register <code>GPFSEL1</code> must be written so that GPIO pin 16 is set as an
output?</p>

<p>Now, read the documentation for the <code>GPSET0</code> and <code>GPCLR0</code> registers on page 95.
We write to <code>GPSET0</code> to <em>set</em> a pin (turn it on) and write to <code>GPCLR0</code> to
<em>clear</em> a pin (turn it off). Which value do we write to which field in these
registers to set/clear pin 16?</p>

<h4 id="writing-the-code">Writing the Code</h4>

<p>The <code>phase3/</code> directory in the assignment skeleton contains a scaffold for
building a binary suitable for running on the Raspberry Pi 3. We won&rsquo;t explain
<code>crt0.S</code>, <code>layout.ld</code>, or <code>Makefile</code> for now. Instead, you&rsquo;ll work on
<code>blinky.c</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>blinky.c</code>, you&rsquo;ll find that we&rsquo;ve declared the physical addresses of the
three relevant registers at the top of the file. Your task is to complete the
<code>main()</code> function so that GPIO pin 16 is set-up as an output and then
continuously set and cleared to blink the LED. We&rsquo;ve also provided rudimentary
&ldquo;sleep&rdquo; functions that stall the CPU for roughly the amount of time the function
name indicates. You can use these to pause between sets and clears.</p>

<p>When you are ready to test your program, compile it by running <code>make</code> in your
shell. If all goes well, this will create the file <code>blinky.bin</code> which you can
rename <code>kernel8.img</code> and copy to your microSD card to run on your Raspberry Pi.
When you have a working <code>kernel8.img</code>, proceed to phase 4.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="phase-4-rusting-away">Phase 4: Rusting Away</h3>

<p>In this phase, you&rsquo;ll write the program that produced <code>gpio16-blink.bin</code> in
Rust. You&rsquo;ll write your code in <code>phase4/src/lib.rs</code>.</p>

<h4 id="installing-rust-and-xargo">Installing Rust and Xargo</h4>

<p>To compile Rust programs, we first need to install the Rust compiler. We&rsquo;ll also
install <code>xargo</code>, a wrapper around Rust&rsquo;s package manager <code>cargo</code> that lets us
easily compile for targets like the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to <a href="https://rustup.rs">https://rustup.rs</a> and follow the instructions to install <code>rustup</code>.
 Ensure that Rust was installed successfully by running <code>rustc --version</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ll now use <code>rustup</code> and <code>cargo</code> to switch to a <em>nightly</em> release of
 Rust, install the source code for Rust&rsquo;s standard libraries onto our
 machine, and install <code>xargo</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rustup default nightly-2018-01-09
rustup component add rust-src
cargo install xargo</code></pre></div></li>

<li><p>Test the installed commands and ensure your versions match:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">$ rustc --version
rustc <span style="color:#1c01ce">1</span>.25.0-nightly <span style="color:#000">(</span>b5392f545 <span style="color:#1c01ce">2018</span>-01-08<span style="color:#000">)</span>
$ xargo --version
xargo <span style="color:#1c01ce">0</span>.3.10
cargo <span style="color:#1c01ce">0</span>.25.0-nightly <span style="color:#000">(</span>a88fbace4 <span style="color:#1c01ce">2017</span>-12-29<span style="color:#000">)</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! You now have a working Rust compiler running on your system.</p>

<h4 id="writing-the-code-1">Writing the Code</h4>

<p>To write the required code in <code>phase4/src/lib.rs</code>, you&rsquo;ll only need to know the
following Rust:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can read and write from a raw pointer (<code>*mut T</code>) using the
 <code>read_volatile()</code> and <code>write_volatile()</code> methods.</p>

<p>For example, if we have the following declarations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#a90d91">const</span> <span style="color:#000">A</span>: <span style="color:#000">*</span><span style="color:#a90d91">mut</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">u32</span> <span style="color:#000">=</span> <span style="color:#1c01ce">0x12</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">as</span> <span style="color:#000">*</span><span style="color:#a90d91">mut</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">u32</span>;
<span style="color:#a90d91">const</span> <span style="color:#000">B</span>: <span style="color:#000">*</span><span style="color:#a90d91">mut</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">u32</span> <span style="color:#000">=</span> <span style="color:#1c01ce">0x34</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">as</span> <span style="color:#000">*</span><span style="color:#a90d91">mut</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">u32</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can write the 32-bit unsigned integer at address <code>0x12</code> to <code>0x34</code> with
 the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#000">B</span>.<span style="color:#000">write_volatile</span>(<span style="color:#000">A</span>.<span style="color:#000">read_volatile</span>());
</code></pre></div></li>

<li><p>Local variables can be declared with <code>let variable_name = expression;</code>.</p>

<p>Using the <code>A</code> declaration from the previous example, we can read the value
 at address <code>0x12</code> to a local variable <code>value</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#a90d91">let</span> <span style="color:#000">value</span> <span style="color:#000">=</span> <span style="color:#000">A</span>.<span style="color:#000">read_volatile</span>()
</code></pre></div></li>

<li><p>You can call a function <code>fn f(param: usize);</code> with <code>f(123);</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>A <code>loop</code> block can be used to repeat a block infinitely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#a90d91">loop</span> {
    <span style="color:#000">do_this_again_and_again</span>();
}
</code></pre></div></li>

<li><p>Rust defines the following bitwise operators:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>!</code> - unary bitwise inversion</li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> - left shift binary operator</li>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> - right shift binary operator</li>
<li><code>|</code> - bitwise OR binary operator</li>
<li><code>&amp;</code> - bitwise AND binary operator</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>You are now ready to implement the blink program in <code>phase4/src/lib.rs</code>.
Translate your C implementation into Rust in the <code>kmain</code> function. You&rsquo;ll find
that we&rsquo;ve declared the physical addresses of the three relevant registers at
the top of the file. We&rsquo;ve also provided a rudimentary &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; function that
stalls the CPU for roughly the amount of time the function name indicates. You
can use the function to pause between sets and clears.</p>

<p>When you are ready to test your program, compile it by running <code>make</code> from the
<code>phase4</code> directory in your shell. If all goes well, this will create the file
<code>build/blinky.bin</code> which you can rename <code>kernel8.img</code> and copy to your microSD
card to run on your Raspberry Pi. When you have a working <code>kernel8.img</code>, you
have completed assignment 0! Proceed to the next phase for submission
instructions.</p>
