<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Welcome to the last assignment: the final exam! ðŸŽ‰</p>

<p>In the beginning of the term, we noted that we wanted to do things a bit
differently in CS140e. The final exam is no exception. Instead of the
traditional 2 to 3 hour sit-down, on-paper exam, you&rsquo;ll be writing a 5 - 7 page
<em>course summary</em>. The summary should consolidate all of the material you&rsquo;ve
learned in CS140e including everything we&rsquo;ve taught in lecture and assignments.</p>

<p>In lecture, we generally discussed fundamental principles of operating systems:
things like what an operating system is and does and how file systems work. In
assignments, you implemented a specific instance of many of those principles,
though not all of them. The primary goal of your summary is to consolidate all
of these topics into one cohesive, complete, and pithy story about operating
system design and implementation.</p>

<p>Later on, we provide an outline that your summary should adhere to. The outline
isn&rsquo;t prescriptive. This is <em>writing</em>, after all, so feel free to be creative as
long as you touch on most of the points in the outline. We also provide grading
criteria with writing samples in an effort to illustrate what we expect. Our
intention is for this to be a fruitful, relaxed exercise that solidifies your
understanding of the course material. Good luck!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-rules">The Rules</h3>

<p>You are explicitly allowed to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use your personal notes.</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use handouts passed out during lecture.</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use any online material to clarify concepts.</strong></p>

<p>You may use any material you find online as a reference. All writing must be
your own. Only use external material as a source of truth, never as a source
of writing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Discuss with colleagues at a high level.</strong></p>

<p>You may (and we <em>strongly</em> encourage you to!) converse with fellow
classmates about any of the course material. All writing must be your own.</p></li>

<p>You may continue to ask for clarification about course topics on Piazza, at
lab, and at office hours. If your question includes extensive details about
a particular subject, please post the question privately.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your must not:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Plagarize.</strong></p>

<p>This is a given; please don&rsquo;t plagirize! Doing so is a serious offense and
will require us to escalate the matter.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Share writing with a colleague.</strong></p>

<p>All writing must be your own original work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about what&rsquo;s allowed and what isn&rsquo;t, <strong>please ask</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

<p>The page layout for your summary must conform to the following specifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>no more than 7 single-spaced, 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; pages, including diagrams</li>
<li>as many additional pages as needed for references and feedback</li>
<li>10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading</li>
<li>two columns with 0.85cm of separation</li>
<li>a top, right, bottom, and left margin of 0.80in</li>
<li>Times Roman or similar font</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="latex">LaTeX</h4>

<p>We have provided a LaTeX template that meets these specifications. If you do not
already have a LaTeX distribution installed and wish to use the template, we
recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>On macOS: <code>brew cask install mactex</code> or <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a></li>
<li>On Ubuntu: <code>apt-get install texlive-full</code></li>
<li>On Fedora: <code>dnf install texlive-scheme-full</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can clone the template repository by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git clone https://cs140e.sergio.bz/assignments/final/skeleton.git final</code></pre></div>
<p>You can render the <code>summary.tex</code> file into <code>summary.pdf</code> by calling <code>make</code>. To
have <code>latexmk</code> continuously render the PDF as you edit, run <code>make watch</code>.</p>

<h4 id="word">Word</h4>

<p>We also provide a Word template, courtesy of Roslyn Cyrus, if you prefer to use
Word. You can <a href="final/data/template.docx">download it by clicking here</a>. Due to
differences between Word versions, you should ensure that the template meets the
above specifications on your particular setup before using it.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="outline">Outline</h3>

<p>Your summary should be between 5 and 7 pages when rendered as a PDF. Fewer pages
are allowed if you feel that you have covered all of the material, but you must
not exceed 7 pages. Our expectation is that you will spend no more than a day or
two working on this summary.</p>

<p>The outline below lists specific topics that your summary should include. <strong>You
shouldn&rsquo;t write towards the outline.</strong> Instead, you should use the outline to
guide your writing towards a cohesive story about operating systems that
includes most of these topics. Feel free to write about ideas that aren&rsquo;t
explicitly mentioned in the outline. Don&rsquo;t feel that you must touch on
absolutely everything in the outline. It is better to be clear about a few
important topics than it is to write about every topic in an unclear manner.</p>

<p>We expect your summary to read as a narrative or guide to operating systems, not
as a series of answers to questions or fragmented ideas. Think about what future
students in CS140e would benefit from reading and write towards them. Feel free
to use diagrams, code fragments, illustrations, tables, and figures liberally.</p>

<p>Your summary should cover the majority of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rust</strong> (2 lectures)</p>

<p>Your summary should discuss the Rust programming language and its role in
operating systems development. You should seek to respond to many, though
not necessarily all, of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are some unique, key properties of Rust?</p></li>

<li><p>Describe the role of lifetimes and ownership in preventing memory errors.</p></li>

<li><p>What advantages does Rust have when developing operating systems?</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a few examples where something that is relatively easy to do in a
language like C, such as dereferencing a raw pointer, is more complicated
or different in Rust. Why?</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a few examples where something that can be done concisely in Rust
is more verbose in a language like C.</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Device Drivers</strong> (1 lecture)</p>

<p>Your summary should describe what a device driver is and how it fits in with
the bigger picture of operating systems. You should describe the key
differences between device drivers and other software both in the kernel and
outside of the kernel.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>File Systems</strong> (3 lectures)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Both disk and main memory store values. Discuss the similarities and
differences between disk and memory.</p></li>

<li><p>Give the shortest, intuitive description of what files and directories
do, along with the approximate equivalant Rust constructs. (Directories
 might need two, depending on how you view them.)</p></li>

<li><p>Describe a few common workloads and common FS implementation
optimizations for them.</p></li>

<li><p>Sketch a couple rules for writing in-memory data and metadata to disk so
that the file system can be correctly recovered after a crash (as
discussed these in class). Give one example mistake and its consequences.</p></li>

<li><p>Give the intuition for how a logging (not log structured) file system
works. What happens on crash? What do you do if you crash while repairing
a crash?</p></li>

<li><p>Quickly sketch (few sentences at most) how to systematically test a
storage system using the <code>choose()</code> interface described in class.</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Linking</strong> (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> lecture)</p>

<p>Your summary should describe the linker&rsquo;s role in compilation. In
particular, it should answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the linkers primary task? How does it work?</p></li>

<li><p>How does the role of a linker change based on the language being
compiled?</p></li>

<li><p>What and how much control do programmers have of the linker&rsquo;s actions?</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Memory Allocation</strong> (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> lecture)</p>

<p>Your summary should describe memory allocation at two levels: first, in the
kernel, and second, in user space. It should also describe how these two
levels interact. You should seek to answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the role of a memory allocator? Why do they exist?</p></li>

<li><p>What are important characteristics of &ldquo;good&rdquo; memory allocators?</p></li>

<li><p>What are characteristics of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; memory allocators?</p></li>

<li><p>How does an allocator&rsquo;s interface affect the implementation of the
allocator?</p></li>

<li><p>How do different programming language interface with memory
allocators?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You should describe particular kinds of memory allocators and their
trade-offs and differences. When describing particular implementations of
memory allocators, illustrations and code examples will be particularly
useful.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Virtual Memory</strong> (2 lectures)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What problems would show up if we didn&rsquo;t have virtual memory (VM)?</p></li>

<li><p>Compare page-based VM to segmentation-based.  Despite its downsides
(which are?) page-based has largely won: what&rsquo;s the crucial advantage
advantage it has?  What&rsquo;s the advantage of segmentation over page-based
and give a workload where it&rsquo;d work better.</p></li>

<li><p>Describe what happens when a TLB fault occurs for both a
hardware-controlled and a software-controlled TLB.</p></li>

<li><p>If we do not map page tables using virtual memory (i.e., they are
referred to with physical addresses), what are advantages/disadvantages
compared to mapping them virtually? How do we handle translations faults
during translation faults if they are virtual?</p></li>

<li><p>When are memory allocation and virtual memory used to do approximately
the same thing? What are some reasons that their approaches are so
different?</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Processes</strong> (4 lectures)</p>

<p>Your summary should describe the design, structure, and implementation of
processes. It should also describe when processes are allowed to communicate
with eachother and how they do so. Your discussion about processes should be
detailed. Your summary should seek to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Processes and IPC</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why do processes exist? What problems do they solve?</p></li>

<li><p>What abstractions do processes provide and why?</p></li>

<li><p>How are processes implemented?</p></li>

<li><p>How are processes managed and protected by the operating system?</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Scheduling</strong></p>

<p>Your summary should describe how operating systems schedule tasks. It should
describe the characteristics of good and bad schedulers with details about
specific scheduling algorithms and the implications of their design.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Interrupts and Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>Your summary should explain what interrupts and exceptions are as well as
their role in an operating system. It should seek to answer the following
questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What utility do interrupts and exceptions provide?</p></li>

<li><p>What abstractions do operating systems create for interrupts and
exceptions?</p></li>

<li><p>What mechanisms do CPUs use to deliver interrupts and exceptions?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It should describe specific scenarios where interrupts are key to the
implementation of operating systems.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Privilege Levels and System Calls</strong></p>

<p>Your summary should explain the role of system calls in operating systems
and why they are necessary. It should describe system calls in the context
of privilege levels and privilege separation.</p>

<p>The discussion on system calls should include details on how they are
implemented and what effect their interface has on the overall interface of
an operating system. It should also describe how typical users interact with
system calls.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Synchronization</strong> (1 lecture)</p>

<p>Your summary should discuss synchronization concerns in programs with
concurrent execution. In particular, it should seek to the answer the
following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is <em>synchronization</em>? What is <em>cache coherence</em>?</p></li>

<li><p>What mechanisms can be used to synchronize operations?</p></li>

<li><p>What mechanisms and algorithms can be used to provide cache coherence?</p></li>

<li><p>What role does the CPU play in enabling synchronization and coherence?</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Virtual Machines</strong> (1 lecture)</p>

<p>Note: the following are more suggestions than requirements, since the
readings didn&rsquo;t discuss some of these aspects.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would you use a virtual machine monitor (VMM)? What&rsquo;s the difference
between virtualization and simulation (hint: in class, we claimed not
much)?</p></li>

<li><p>If you have a workload where the program counter (pc) is almost always in
user code, and another where the pc is almost always in systems code, how
do you expect these to perform on a VMM?</p></li>

<li><p>What&rsquo;s the general methodology for running an OS on top of a VMM as a
guest OS &ldquo;process&rdquo;?</p></li>

<li><p>Explain &ldquo;trap and emulate&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>Why doesn&rsquo;t VMWare statically translate guest OS code before-hand?</p></li>

<li><p>Generally, people define &ldquo;code&rdquo; as what&rsquo;s in the code (text) segment of
an executable. How does VMWare&rsquo;s definition of code differ? How does it
translate code? (Note that binary program checkers such as valgrind and
pin both define and translate code in much the same way.) Does it have to
translate user-level application code? Explain.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="writing-samples">Writing Samples</h3>

<p>To help you guage your writing, we provide three writing samples for a
particular outline topic. For each writing sample, we list the grade that the
summary would receive as well why the summary received that grade. Note that in
your writing, you should seek to explore relationships between topics as much as
possible.</p>

<h4 id="topic">Topic</h4>

<p>The topic for these writing samples is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Access Control</strong></p>

<p>Your summary should explain the role of access control in operating systems.
In particular, it should seek to answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are the common forms of access control?</p></li>

<li><p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of different access control
implmentations?</p></li>

<li><p>How do operating systems enforce access control?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="writing-sample-a">Writing Sample A</h4>

<p>The following summary for the topic would receive an <strong>A</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><h5 id="background">Background</h5>

<p>The introduction of multi-user operating systems begged the question about
how to share and protect data associated with different users on the same
physical machine. How could Alice prevent Bob from reading her confidential
files while allowing Carol to read them? Solutions to this problem, and more
generally to the problem of enforcing policies on resources owned by
different users, is known as <em>access control</em>.</p>

<p>There are many forms of access control with complex and entwined
relationships, but all forms have some shared characteristics. In
particular, they all ascribe the concept of an identity to users. A user&rsquo;s
identity is used to specify policies. Identities aren&rsquo;t necessarily unique.
In Unix based operating systems, for instance, each user is associated with
a user ID, a unique identity, and a group ID, a non-unique identity. Both
identities can be used to enforce access control.</p>

<h5 id="mandatory-access-control">Mandatory Access Control</h5>

<p>Two forms of access control see pervasive use today. The first, <em>mandatory
access control</em> or MAC, allows an administrator to specify policies that the
system enforces at every access point. The policy is typically specified in
one place. It is consulted on every access to a resource. The policy can
never be modified or violated by a non administrative user; it is always
enforced by the operating system.</p>

<p>An example of a policy might read that only users in a particular group can
read file &ldquo;foo.txt&rdquo;. When the operating system receives a <code>read()</code> system
call for a particular file, it checks the user&rsquo;s group against the policy.
If the policy allows it, the <code>read()</code> is allowed. Otherwise it is denied.</p>

<h5 id="discretionary-access-control">Discretionary Access Control</h5>

<p>The second, <em>discretionary access control</em> or DAC, propagates the idea of
&ldquo;ownership&rdquo; to resources managed by the operating system. The distinguishing
feature of a DAC based access control system is that it allows any user with
a resource to share that resource forward. In other words, if a user has
access to a resource, then it can do with the resource what it wishes.</p>

<p>As an example, consider that a policy allows user A to open and read a
particular file but not user B. When user A tries to open the file via the
<code>open()</code> system call, the operating system will allow it. If user B tries to
open the same file, the call will be denied. On the other hand, if user A
opens the file and then passes the file descriptor to B, the operating
system will subsequently allow B to read from the file. User A has
effectively shared its permissions to the file at his/her discretion.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>In reality, the complexity of sharing brings about complex access control
systems that are neither purely discretionary nor mandatory. Mandatory
access control is typically too course grained to suffice, while
discretionary access control is typically too flexible. Access control in
Linux, for instance, is both discretionary and mandatory. Linux makes use of
the traditional Unix permission bit based DAC for files. With the advent of
SELinux, however, global policies can be specified that can restrict the
propagation of permissions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This summary has the following <strong>positive</strong> properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It answers all of the questions in the outline using narrative.</p></li>

<li><p>It provides a fairly complete and accurate picture of access control.</p></li>

<li><p>It provides and justifies a singular definition for access control.</p></li>

<li><p>It provides context for why access control exists, illustrating real
problems that it solves.</p></li>

<li><p>It provides examples to help the reader understand the concepts better.</p></li>

<li><p>It explains, in short, how access control applies to modern systems.</p></li>

<li><p>It does not short-change the complexity of the subject.</p></li>

<li><p>While not exceedingly short, it is also not exceedingly long, vying on the
reader&rsquo;s background to shorten the discussion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This summary has the following <strong>negative</strong> properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>No specific example of an implementation for DAC is mentioned.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="writing-sample-b">Writing Sample B</h4>

<p>The following summary for the topic would receive a <strong>B</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><h5 id="background-1">Background</h5>

<p>Operating systems manage resources for users. Users expect the operating
system to protect their resources from other users. The mechanisms by which
an operating system accomplishes this is known as access control.</p>

<p>There are many forms of access control. In many of them, users are given an
identity, such as user IDs in Unix based operating systems. When a resource
is accessed by a user, the operating system checks the user&rsquo;s ID against a
policy. The access is only allowed if the policy allows it.</p>

<p>There are two primary kinds of policies in use today.</p>

<h5 id="mandatory-access-control-1">Mandatory Access Control</h5>

<p>The first, <em>mandatory access control</em> or MAC, allows an administrator to
specify policies that are enforced by the system every time an access
occurs. There is typically one policy. The policy can only be modified by an
administrator, and the operating system makes sure to check the policy for
every access.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following policy:</p>

<pre><code>user A can read foo
user B cannot read foo
</code></pre>

<p>If a user A tries to read foo, then the operating system will allow the
read. On the other hand, if a user B tries to read the same file, it won&rsquo;t
be allowed. Neither A nor B can modify this policy.</p>

<h5 id="discretionary-access-control-1">Discretionary Access Control</h5>

<p>The second, <em>discretionary access control</em> or DAC, allows users to share
permissions for a particular resource. Using the same policy from the
previous example in a DAC context, a DAC based access control system would
allow user A to pass a handle to foo to user B. User B would then be able to
read the file because A used discretion to pass the permissions to user B.</p>

<h5 id="comparison">Comparison</h5>

<p>Whether you use DAC or MAC depends on which properties the system desires.
In particular, if resources are viewed as being &ldquo;owned&rdquo;, then DAC&rsquo;s
abilities to share resource is more appropriate. DACs can prove to be too
lenient, however; it is not always the case that a user&rsquo;s access to some
resources implies that it can share that access.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, there is a central policy authority, then MAC is the
better option. The downside is, of course, is that MAC can be too
restrictive and static. Once the decision is made, it is difficult to
change.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h5>

<p>It is also possible for an operating system to use both MAC and DAC.
Continuing with the example above, a MAC/DAC hybrid might allow A to share
foo with B but still deny B from reading the file. Linux, for example, uses
a model that is closer to this.</p></li>

<p>The following summary for the topic would receive a <strong>C</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><h5 id="background-2">Background</h5>

<p>Operating systems manage resources for users. Users expect the operating
system to protect their resources from other users. The mechanisms by which
an operating system accomplishes this is known as access control.</p>

<p>There are two forms of access control, both of which give users a unique
identity. When a resource is accessed by a user, the operating system checks
the user&rsquo;s ID against some kind of policy, which depends on the kind of
access control. The access is only allowed if the policy allows it.</p>

<p>The first kind of access control, <em>mandatory access control</em> or MAC, allows
an administrator to globally enforce a policy. This usually done by allowing
the administrator to set permissions bits on resources. In Linux, for
example, only the administrator can change the permissions of files. Once
the change is made, access to that resources are enforced by the operating
system. It is also possible to specify policies in a single file.</p>

<p>The second, <em>discretionary access control</em> or DAC, allows users to share
permissions for a particular resource. For example, a user can pass a file
that is owned by them to a different user. This way, the user can read the
file where previously they could not. It is up to the user (their
discretion) on whether they want to share the resource or not.</p>

<h5 id="comparison-1">Comparison</h5>

<p>DAC is usually faster since the permissions are checked on the resource
itself. There is no global policy, so checks can be made locally.
Furthermore, DAC allows you share permissions. It is more flexible that MAC.</p>

<p>MAC is typically stricer since the same policy is enforced on all files
instead of on a per-file basis. It can also be less performant.</p>

<h5 id="enforcement-implementation">Enforcement Implementation</h5>

<p>Operating systems enforce access control at the system call layer. For every
system call that&rsquo;s made, the operating system will check that the user ID
is identified as having the permissions needed in the policy. For DAC, this
means checking the bits in the file. For MAC, this means checking the policy
file.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h5>

<p>It is also possible for an operating system to use both MAC and DAC. In
fact, Linux uses both at the same time.</p></li>

<h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3>

<p>A sincere <strong>thank you</strong> for taking part in this inaugural incarnation of CS140e.
It has been an absolute pleasure interacting with each and every one of you. I
could not have asked for a better group of students.</p>

<p>I genuinely hope that you have learned a great deal throughout the course and
that you are able to apply what you have learned in your future endeavors.
Operating systems are complex, but they are not complicated. I trust that you
have seen this first-hand through the course assignments. Of course, there is an
incredible wealth of information about operating systems that we did not cover,
but you should now be in a position to discover and acquire that material on
your own. If you have any questions, I am always up for a chat about operating
systems.</p>

<p>A warm thank you to the course staff for their time and efforts: <strong>Dawson
Engler</strong>, for allowing me to shoehorn Rust and 64-bit ARM into a brand new
operating systems course, for having invaluable insights about what works and
doesn&rsquo;t, and for confiding in me to deliver on the course. And <strong>Jennifer Lin</strong>,
for exceeding all expectations about what it means to be a wonderful TA.</p>

<p>Until next time!<br />
Sergio</p>
