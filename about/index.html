<h3 id="about-this-course">About This Course</h3>

<p>CS140e is an experimental course offering in operating systems. Students should
expect the course to have rough edges since it is the first offering. In CS140e,
students implement a simple, clean operating system (virtual memory, processes,
file system) on a Raspberry Pi 3 in the Rust programming language and use the
result to run a variety of devices.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The prerequisite for this class is CS110 or the equivalent.</p>

<h3 id="compared-to-cs140">Compared to CS140</h3>

<p>CS140e uses up-to-date software (modern programming languages and tools) and
hardware (64-bit, multicore architectures). CS140e explores the details of
bare-metal software including the boot process and device drivers in the context
of an embedded platform, the Raspberry Pi. Everything happens in the physical
world; CS140e does not use emulators or virtual machines. Similar to CS140,
CS140e also aims to provide a wholistic introduction to operating systems
concepts such as protection and isolation through mechanisms such as virtual
memory and processes.</p>

<h3 id="course-organization-and-workload">Course Organization and Workload</h3>

<p>This course consists of lectures, five assignments, a midterm, and a final exam.
This course also consists of optional labs.</p>

<p>Lectures are held twice a week and primarily cover theoretical and conceptual
operating systems fundamentals. Assignments guide students towards implementing
an operating system from scratch on a Raspberry Pi 3 in Rust. The expected
workload is 10 - 15 hours per week per assignment.</p>

<p>Labs are held twice a week. Lab sessions give students an opportunity to work on
assignments with guidance from course staff and cooperation with other students.
Labs are optional but students are highly encouraged to attend at least one lab
session per week.</p>

<h3 id="grading-policy">Grading Policy</h3>

<p>Your grade will be a function of your class ranking and where we set the
thresholds for letter grades.  Your class ranking will be based 55% on
assignments, 20% on the midterm, and 25% on the final exam. A +/- 5%
participation adjustment will be made for extraordinary cases. Our decision on
grade thresholds will factor in class participation a second time.</p>

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

<p>There will be two exams. They will be open book/notes but not open laptop. The
final exam is cumulative but will focus primarily on the material in the
second-half of the quarter.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

<p>There will be five assignments. The intent is to (1) practice operating systems
concepts and (2) add new tools to your systems programming toolset. Except for
assignment 0, you will be given approximately two weeks to complete each
assignment. We expect that each assignment will take 10 - 15 hours per week to
complete.</p>
